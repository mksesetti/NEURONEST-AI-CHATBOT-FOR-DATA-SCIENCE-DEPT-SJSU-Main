# NEURONEST-AI-CHATBOT-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE-DEPT-SJSU
## Neuronest: Advancing Applied Sciences at San Jose State University with State-of-the-Art AI Chatbot

Welcome to Neuronest, an innovative AI chatbot meticulously crafted to cater to the distinctive needs of the Applied Sciences department at San Jose State University (SJSU). Leveraging cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI techniques, Neuronest empowers students and faculty alike with intuitive and efficient interaction capabilities.

## Project Overview:

Neuronest is fueled by a meticulously curated dataset sourced from the official SJSU website, meticulously extracted and cleansed using advanced data scraping techniques facilitated by Selenium. Our team's dedication to data cleanliness ensures optimal model readiness, laying the groundwork for sophisticated AI-driven interactions.

## Key Components:

Data Acquisition and Cleansing: The foundation of Neuronest is laid within the GenerateQA.ipynb file, where raw data scraping and subsequent cleansing techniques are meticulously executed. This critical preprocessing stage ensures that the dataset is primed for advanced model ingestion.

Question-Answer Generation: Within the confines of the same GenerateQA.ipynb file lies the innovative code responsible for generating pertinent questions and their corresponding answers. Powered by the state-of-the-art GPT3.5 model, this process transforms raw data into actionable insights.

Modeling and Optimization: Neuronest's core functionality is brought to life through a series of advanced modeling techniques, each meticulously implemented within dedicated Jupyter notebooks.

GPT Fine-Tuning: Explore the nuances of fine-tuning GPT3.5 to suit the complexities of SJSU's domain-specific needs in the GPT_Fine_tuned.ipynb file.

LLama2 Integration: Delve into the complexity of integrating the LLama2 model for enhanced performance in the llama_7b_fine_tuning.ipynb file.

Hybrid Model Implementation: Experience the unparalleled effectiveness of Neuronest's hybrid approach, seamlessly blending the power of GPT and RAG models to achieve superior performance. Witness this synergy firsthand within the RAG_GPT.ipynb file.

Performance Metrics:

Upon rigorous evaluation, our hybrid model, ingeniously combining RAG and GPT architectures, emerged as the clear frontrunner, boasting an impressive BLEU score of 0.76. This exceptional performance underscores Neuronest's unparalleled efficacy in facilitating seamless interactions within the academic sphere.
